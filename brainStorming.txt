compoents :
card- to show poke image and name

adding style with styled components {
    const wrapper = stlyed.div`display:flex;`
}

props can be a function and you call it in another 
compoents and you just provide the parametre
like on cardClick



functions :
(fetchRandomPokemon)a function to get random pokemon data{
    response = axios.get(url)
    return response.data;
}


rerendering :
when an elemnt doesn't change react doesn't re render it -> so to force rerendering I chaned the key each time score+1
